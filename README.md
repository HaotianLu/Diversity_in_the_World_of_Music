+ Project summary: 

I always wonder, with Trump being the President and the US waging trade wars to almost all major economies, are americans or even the people in this world more conservative in their culture?

Since I am a big fan of music and we are offered with data about song lyrics, I would like to give an answer from the perspective of music. A bit more about myself: I practiced vocal music for 7 years, played some Ukelele and, most importantly, am writing this report while listening to Sekei ga Owaru Made wa, SLAM DUNK ED, a masterpiece covered by Ru’s Piano Ru, a great Youtuber that does beautiful piano cover for many if not all of Anime music.

‘The end of words is music’. Ideally, we would get a more honest and sincere answer from music than from President’s Tweets. Let’s get started!
